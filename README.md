# Sarah McDonald Data Analyst Portfolio 

## About me:
I graduated in 2019 with a degree in Biochemistry and spent my undergraduate and post graduate years working in research and healthcare before enrolling in Medical School. Experiences on the patient and provider side of medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic fostered my interest in the impact of data on business, health, and society. This inspired me to retrain as a data analyst, and now as a Graduate Student in Data Science, I am excited to blend my previous experiences as a researcher and healthcare worker with my skillset in data processing to provide valuable insights as a data analyst. 


The following are samples of current and previous data science and data analysis projects. 

### [R: Analysis of NHL Player Statistics to Create Predictive Model for Player Salary](https://spmcdonald1997.github.io/NHL/)
- Imported, cleaned, and analyzed NHL individual player statistics for the 2016-2017 season
- The goal of this project was to create a model using statistics as predictors for player salary
- Ran descriptive statistics on salary information by team and player position
- Created multiple linear regression models predicting salary, compared models for significance and best fit, and generated visualizations of the best model with predictor and outcome graphs.

### [R: Analysis of 2019 COVID data](https://spmcdonald1997.github.io/R_Project/)
- Analyzed 2019 COVID-19 infection information for death rate by country
- Cleaned data to account for missing values and values stored incorrectly 
- Computed statistical significance of mean age for COVID-19 deaths by gender and age
- This is a snapshot of code written in R to assess statistical significance of mean age difference for 2019 COVID-19 survivors and deaths with a two tailed t-test.

### [Python: COVID-19 Vaccine Survey from Pew Research](https://github.com/spmcdonald1997/COVID-19-Vaccine-Analysis---Pew-Research/blob/main/Americans'%20view%20on%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Impact%20on%20U.S.%20Economy.ipynb)
- [Questionaire and materials provided by Pew Research] (https://github.com/spmcdonald1997/COVID-19-Vaccine-Analysis---Pew-Research/tree/main/W83_Feb21)
- Created analysis of American survey respondents' view on economic impact of COVID-19 vaccine using NumPy and Pandas using Pew Research published report
- Generated visualization of the survey results using Matplotlib
- Created crosstabulation of respondents' view of the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the economy, and their overall feelings of the impact of science on society: 
- Here is the sample code for the crosstabulation, and the table output:

pd.crosstab(pewdata.SC1_W83, pewdata.VACCECON_W83, normalize = 'index').round(2).reindex(['Mostly positive', 'Equal positive and negative effects','Mostly negative', 'Refused'])[['Help the economy a lot', 'Help the economy a little', 'Not make much of a difference', 'Refused']]

### [Tableau: Visualization of GDP and CO2 emissions for four sample countries:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FPZGYJNKF?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Created simple visualization of GDP and CO2 emissions on shared axis with sample data provided by Tableau Public
